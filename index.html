                    1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: These attacks aim to restrict a server from serving its clients by targeting network bandwidth or services. In IIoT, DoS attacks can be more damaging, especially in cloud environments, where innocent hosts in the network (zombies) send demands, leading to service disruption.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Side Channel Attacks: Malicious virtual machines placed in the cloud can target the system implementation of cryptographic algorithms, posing a threat to IIoT security.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Cloud Malware Injection: Attackers inject malicious services or worms into virtual machines in the cloud, capable of infecting targets within the cloud system.
                    <br><br>
                    4. Authentication Attacks: Many cloud services still rely on simple username and password authentication, making them vulnerable to attacks. Implementing multi-factor authentication and account locking can help prevent unauthorized access.
                    <br><br>
                    5. Malware Attacks: Malware can be deployed within isolated OT networks, compromising the system's security. This threat is particularly concerning as OT components were not initially designed with security in mind.
                    <br><br>
                    6. Data Manipulation: Attackers may manipulate data in SCADA control systems, HMI, and other critical components, leading to operational disruptions and safety risks.
                    <br><br>
